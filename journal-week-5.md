###Reflection: Week 5

- Chessboard is finally dead
 - learned a lot but didn't quite get it completely
 - linking the controller with my working model
 - importance of MVC

- I'm getting frustrated more easily
  - I know I'm comprehending more even though it may not seem so because I'm not the best at explaining what I've done.
  - correct terminology... -__- nope
  
- APIs/Octocat
  - I have a better understanding of APIs
  - CSS is great but very time consuming
