###Reflection: Week 5

Chessboard is finally dead, yippie! Overall, I learned a whole lot. Yes, it was very frustrating and difficult- but I'm glad we had that assignment. Throughout the duration of this project, I found myself thinking back to the first week of working on this. I knew in my head what needed to be done, I just couldn't implement it. I had so many code revisions, but they all had the same idea. This tells me that I'm growing as a student, I just really need to work on my implementation.

 - learned a lot but didn't quite get it completely
 - linking the controller with my working model
 - importance of MVC

This chessboard assignment (and all that class time I had up there..) really opened my eyes of the importance of terminology... I suck. No, I don't know the lingo yet and I absolutely suck at explaining things. This gets me really frustrated.  I know I'm comprehending more than it seems, even though it may not seem so because I'm not the best at explaining what I've done.
 
  
- APIs/Octocat
  - I have a better understanding of APIs
  - CSS is great but very time consuming
