###Reflection: Week 5

Chessboard is finally dead, yippie! Overall, I learned a whole lot. Yes, it was very frustrating and difficult- but I'm glad we had the assignment. The testing really stumped me and took up a lot of my time. But, now I'm more familiar with this process and how it can be useful. Throughout the duration of this project, I found myself thinking back to the first week of working on this. I knew in my head what needed to be done, I just couldn't implement it. I had so many code revisions, but they were all based on the right concept. This tells me that I'm growing as a student, I just really need to work on my implementation. Overall, this project allowed me to understand MVC and how it works as a whole.

So APIs... I have a better understanding of them- but not quite there. APIs allow programs to talk to one another. They let you write code that will make a request asking another program or script to do something. They also specify the format in which the response will be given (so that the response can be understood). APIs are very useful, I just need dig deeper to actually make it useful for me.
