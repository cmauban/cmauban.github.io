This past week we started learning CSS. The assignments were a lot easier to figure out because we could visually see the changes with trial and error. Multi Column Form was one of the assignments I finally became comfortable with after playing around with the selectors and properties. I had my first "Ah-ha" moment with this assignment after learning how to center with setting the `margin-left: auto;` and `margin-right: auto;`, as well as just creating the basic layout of CSS. This was when I was quickly able to back track and fix my mistakes.

Bright/Dim/Blocker:
- Bright- Choosing the correct selectors and properties
- Dim- positioning the page from the very beginning and getting the right margins
- Blocker- pseudo elements? k..WHY?

Lessons Learned:
- how to begin a CSS file with styles, mobile, tablet and desktop
- how to center with margin-left and margin-right
- linking fonts
