Encapsulation is the principle of information hiding. It is one of the most important principles of object oriented programming. The implementation (the internal workings) of an object is hidden from the rest of the program. An example: driving a car. We don't need to know every aspect of that car (how the engine and alternator work,) but we do need to know how to use it (steering wheel, brakes.)

We used the idea of encapsulation this weekend by working in the DOM. We encapsulated the project and gave the user an interface as they interacted with the browswer. targeting an object, retrieving that data, and applying methods to it. The scripts were rendered on the page individually.

**What I Learned Last Week:**
- Working in the DOM
 - Document object: elements, methods, properties
 - Events, event handlers, event listeners
 - Event order flow: bubbling and capturing
 - HTML Collection and NodeLists
- Calling functions
