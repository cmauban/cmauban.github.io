Encapsulation is the principle of information hiding. It is one of the most important principles of object oriented programming. The implementation, or the internal workings of an object is hidden from the rest of the program. An example: driving a car. We don't need to know every aspect of that car (how the engine and alternator work,) but we do need to know how to use it (steering wheel, brakes.)

We used the idea of encapsulation this past week by working in the DOM. We encapsulated the projects and gave the user an interface as they interacted with the browswer. This past week, we added Javascript back into the Blueprint files through the DOM. The scripts were rendered on the page indicidually. We targeted an object, retrieved that data, and applied methods to it. This practices the idea of encapsulation because we are communicating through the server only, and the user is hidden from what is going on behind the interface. Yes, the user is able to interact with the interface, but they don't know how.

**What I Learned Last Week:**
- Working in the DOM
 - Document object: elements, methods, properties
 - Events, event handlers, event listeners
 - Event order flow: bubbling and capturing
 - HTML Collection and NodeLists
