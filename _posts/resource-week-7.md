Sass lets you add variables to your CSS to store information you want to use throughout your stylesheet. With this resource, you'll learn how to control colors by assigning variables to them in your CSS properties. It even shows you how to adjust your variables! When using only a few colors, variables should be used and placed at the top of your stylesheet for accessibility. This will allow color changes to be more fluid and easy.
