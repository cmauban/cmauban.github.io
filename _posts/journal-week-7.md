##Reflection: Week 7

In week seven we experienced working with a team for the first time. It was nice because I was able to focus on one particual feature and really perfect it, but it was challenging working as a whole. We went from working in our own files, within our own repository, to thirteen people working out of the same repository, in the same files, at the same time. This caused dreaded merge conflicts that were no longer avoidable, as well as some disagreements.

I learned a lot while working with a team, especially working with a team lead. Team leads are necessary for group projects. They give the group a sense of direction and make sure everybody is on track.

As a team lead, I observed that people are set in their own ways and
