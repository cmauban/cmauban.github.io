  <h2 class="project-title">Ziptrip</h2>
  <p class="desc">Ziptrip is a single-page application that generates a personalized road trip for you based
    on your taste in food, music, sports and hobbies. It finds the major cities along the route and suggests stopping points.
    Ziptrip was my final project for The Iron Yard and presented at Demo Day. This AngularJs application was built in less
    than two and a half weeks. I worked on a team of four developers and was responsible for the user interface.</p>
