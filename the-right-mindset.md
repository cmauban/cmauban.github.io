1.Growth mindset: intelligence can be developed, learns from criticism, they process the error and engage deeply. they learn from it and correct it. thrives on a challenge, stretching our abilities, high levels of achievement. "Growth Mindset is the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems."

push out of your comfort zone to learn something new and different, the neurons in the brain can form new, stronger connections, and overtime can get smarter.

Fixed mindset: intelligence is static, avoids challenges, ignores useful negative feedback, they run from error and don't engage with it. achieves less than their full potential.

2.Fixed mindset- Architecture critiques and getting feedback on my designs. was so wrapped up in my ideas I didn't want to change them or take the advice from some of my professors. growth mindset- doing this program. i'm challenging myself and putting myself in a new environment and situation with no previous experience to become better and invest in myself.

3.I am challenging myself and stretching my abilities.
