Dr. Carol Dweck says, "Most people are held back not by their innate ability, but by their mindset." This state caught my attention, and made me want to read more. The growth mindset is what everyone should aim for to reach their goals. People with this mindset aren't afraid of a challenge or stretching their abilities. It is the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. The growth mindset allows a person to learn from criticism and correct it. On the other hand, a fixed mindset avoids challenges and runs from error. They ignore useful negative feedback and avoid failure. The big difference between these two mindsets is that one will have high levels of achievement while the other will achieve less than their full potential.

I have experienced both mindsets in college. Sophomore year in college I completely changed my major just because of one class- chemistry. I was a nursing major but hated all of the chemistry classes and didn't care for them. So instead of accepting this challenge, I gave up, and changed my major. In the long run it all worked out because I really liked my new major, Architecutral Technology. This challenged me in ways I've never been challenged before. I was one of the only girls in my classes but it made me want to do better. I spent so many hours in the studio working on my designs, projects and drawings. In the end, I was recognized at the graduation ceremony and awarded as the "Outstanding Student."

I'm coming into this program with a growth mindset. I came here on my own time wanting to learn something way out of my comfort zone. This program will be very difficult, and I know sometimes I'll probably have a fixed mindset breifley. But I'm spending the money, I want to be successful, and I know I can do it. Every bit of feedback I get I know will be useful- especially in code. This will just make me a better. Anyone can do whatever they put their mind to.
