##Reflection: Week 4

Week four was a bit of a struggle- mainly just the dang chessboard. Though, working with each project and using the new tools constantly throughout the week clarified a lot for me. Practice makes perfect.

- understanding node-sass
- working with browser-sync
- jQuery on the blueprints
- understanding package.json
- this chessboard doe..
