##Reflection: Week 4

Week four was a bit of a struggle- mainly just the dang chessboard. Though, working with each project and using the new tools constantly throughout the week clarified a lot for me. Practice makes perfect. It took a couple days to actually understand what we wanted to do with the chessboard. Once I had an idea of what I needed to do, I couldn't translate that to apply a move. After looking over other people's solutions, I want to go back and fix mine with an understanding.

Now that we have learned SASS, we converted our blueprint CSS files into SCSS with node-sass. I ended up nesting too much and messing up my beautiful CSS files! This was frustrating- especially for my multi-column form blueprint. I thought nesting was helpful at first. I thought we could take the common properties of selectors and group them together with the common properties applying to everything that is nested. Unfortunely, that is not the case.

- Adding jQuery to our blueprints was a lot easier than adding vanilla javascript.
- Yes! I finally understand what the package.json is and how it works! A package.json file stores all of the information for project. You can see how to set up your package.json file in my tutorial.
- understanding node-sass
- working with browser-sync
