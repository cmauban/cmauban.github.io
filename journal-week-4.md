##Reflection: Week 4

Week four was a bit of a struggle- mainly just the dang chessboard. Though, working with each project and using the new tools constantly throughout the week clarified a lot for me. Practice makes perfect.

It took a couple days to actually understand what we wanted to do with the chessboard. Once I figured out what I needed to do, I couldn't translate that into code. 

Now that we have learned SASS, we converted our blueprint CSS files into SCSS with node-sass. I ended up nesting too much and messing up my beautiful CSS files! This was frustrating- especially for my multi-column form blueprint.

Adding jQuery to our blueprints was a lot easier than adding vanilla javascript.

Yes! I finally understand what the package.json is and how it works! A package.json file stores all of the information for project. You can see how to set up your package.json file in my tutorial.
