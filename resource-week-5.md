###Resource: HTML Element Reference

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Content_sectioning

This comes in handy when you find yourself creating a lot of of the same element tags in your HTML. When I was told to not use `<div>` or `<span>` tags, I found myself grouping content with a whole lot of `<section>` tags. By using this as a reference, you'll be able to easily find a different element tag to use, plus be more **semantic!**
