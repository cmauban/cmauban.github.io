1. Test Driven Development (TDD): red green refractor (broken code). software development process that relies on the repetition of a short cycle. first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.
2. Pair Programming:
 - pilot - co poilot (pilot write code. co poilot reviews each line of code.)
 - ping-pong (one person write code and sees if it fails, then the other implements the code needed to pass the test)
 
3. Baby steps

####What I've learned:
- functions
- if else statements
- loops- for, while
- arrays- methods
